Description: From the comments mined from Twitter related to cryptocurrency, create prediction models that can predict the emotional label of each comment. 

Details: We have labeled comments from Twitter. We will split our data. We train our models on the training sets. Then, we test our trained models with the testing sets.

Goals: We will each use a different model in order to identify the labels and will then compare the accuracy of the models and why it might be the case.

Details about the Data that you are using:
The data provided is a collection of six JSON files. Each file contains comments pertaining to an emotion surrounding the cryptocurrency topics. Each comment is labeled with an emotional label. Those emotional labels are anger, fear, greed, hateful, joy, and sadness.
